The behavior you’re describing is known as Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which is a feature provided by many modern development servers, including the one used by Next.js. HMR enhances the development experience by updating modules in the browser at runtime without needing a full refresh. This means that when you make changes to your code, those changes can be instantly reflected in the browser without having to stop and restart the server or manually reload the page.

Here’s how it works:

1. When you run npm run dev, the development server starts, and it watches for file changes in your project.
2. If you modify a file, the development server detects the change.
3. The server then updates the changed modules on the page while preserving the application state.
4. This process happens in the background, so you see the changes immediately without a page reload.

This feature is particularly useful for preserving the state of your application during development, which can save time and improve productivity.
